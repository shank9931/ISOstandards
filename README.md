# ISOstandards

Automation of validity check of ISO standards.

A simple python script implementing the following:
1. opening the excel file with the links for the standards
2. sending a get.request
3. looking for the status element in the HTML

- this was very easy, the site has the information directly in the HTML and not behind an API or JavaScript.
